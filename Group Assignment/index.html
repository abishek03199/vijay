<b>Introduction </b>
       <li> <b>Group Name: Economic Inequality </b> </li>
       <li>  We are the Economic Inequality Group (for now, at least! We are not entirely settled on our name). We are interested in exploring the relationship between income inequality, globalization, and labor issues and want to combine web-mapping and case studies as a way to explore these connections on both global and individual levels.  </li>

<b>Overview</b>
   <p class="tab"> We aim to tell the story of working poverty on a global scale. Our final map will display the relationships between working poverty and other variables. The working poverty rate shows the number of people who are employed but still under the poverty line: according to the <a href="https://ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_696387.pdf"> International Labor Organization </a>, more than 20% of employed persons lived in poverty in 2018. While the percentage of working poor in the global population has been steadily declining since 2000, the decline has slowed in the last decade, and it is important to bring renewed interest to this topic. 
We plan to complete case studies on countries with the highest and lowest rates of working poverty to determine which other variables are most significant, but we are initially looking to display information on stage in the supply chain, private property rights, or labor rights. Our final map will display working poverty information by default and include toggles for the most significant variables so viewers can see the correlation between working poverty and each variable. Viewers will also be able to click into countries to read relevant case studies. 

 </p>
<b>Methodology</b>
   <p class="tab"> For this project, web mapping will articulate a special visualization of different areas of the world that have different levels of poverty.
     Within a globalization context, working poverty by country can help us understand the different correlations each country's poverty level has to supply chains, private property rights or labor rights. To capture the scale of poverty, 
    the map will not only educate others about these correlations but have a clearer view of how poverty is connected to economic inequality. </p>

<b>Geographic scope</b>
   <p class="tab"> The scope of our project looks to explore global data.</p>
<b>Data</b> 
<ul>
<li> Our project seeks to answer the question of why some countries are poorer than others, where we focus on potential factors such as their dominant economic sectors, state of private property rights, or labor rights.  </li>
<li> We are interested in the working poverty rate which can be found in the International Labor Organization’s free labor statistics, the World Bank’s Property Rights Score to assess the state of local private property rights and the International Trade Union Confederation’s Global Rights Index to assess the local state of workers’ rights. </li>
