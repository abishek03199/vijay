# "Laborinth" Blog Entry : Week 3 Progress #

## Inspiring Sites 
1. [World Poverty Map](https://worldpoverty.io/map) shows a chloropleth map where color indicates the poverty level of each country 

## Datasets of Interest
Our group is interested in the question of "How do labor rights issues affect poverty rates?" and we want to explore if there are correlations with the day-to-day experiences of the working class. From our research, we noticed that there were several Labor Indices that are already out there. This is great and we want to bring their findings to life. Hence, we have narrowed down our project to focus on the link between labor conditions and working poverty rates around the world. 

In terms of working poverty rates, we will be using this dataset. We wanted to narrow it down to [working poverty rates](https://www.ilo.org/shinyapps/bulkexplorer22/?lang=en&segment=indicator&id=EMP_2EMP_SEX_AGE_CLA_NB_A)  rather than poverty rates because we want our project to revolve around the experiences of people who are employed. 

The next step is to decide what labor conditions we are interested in. There is data collected by the International Labor Conditions for 25 components that collective make up their Labor Index. There is a Labor Standard which is recommended by the ILO. We are still at a crossroads of deciding which components we want to highlight. If we could construct a bouillon true/false such as to indicate whether a country even has "Minimum Wage Laws" or not, we would be able to include as many components as possible. Here is our main [reference](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_672549.pdf) for how the components are defined. Another concern we have is whether it is meaningful to compare numbers across different economic contexts. 

## Our Vision of the Site
We would use color to show the different poverty levels across countries, similar to the World Poverty Map. We would have a sidebar that lists all of the labor components we have data on. The user would click on each component, one at a time to learn more about each component. To get an overview of the labor conditions in each country, we would want each country to have a visible circle, where useres can click on to see a box with a summary of labor conditions.

## Responsibilities and Progress 
### Edryna: Finalize datasets by this week

### Annika: Write the content for the website as well as identify and research countries to highlight our questions.

### Radha: Clean and refine the dataset and help develope UX experience

### Jack: Develop wireframe and begin writing code for website to visualize ideas.

## Our Hopes for the Site's Impact

Our hope in pursuing this project is to help shed light on why certain countries have developed and other countries have not. Through exploring a number of different social and economic indicators we hope to give a potential explanation for this situation. Economic development data is often highly politicized and weaponized. Our group hopes to give an objective analysis of these relationships, with a special interest in labor rights. In hopes that others can use this information to better understand the link between labor and poverty.

Web mapping will articulate a visualization of different areas of the world that have different levels of poverty. Within a globalization context, working poverty by country can help us understand the different correlations each country's poverty level has to labor rights. To capture the scale of poverty, the map will not only educate others about these correlations but have a clearer view of how poverty is connected to economic inequality.



## Images for Inspiration

## Max Galka's Net Migration Map:

Notes: Our team liked the simplicity and movment of this map. This animated visualization shows the estimated net immigration between global countries from 2010 to 2015. Hover over the circles to see the net immigration totalsâ€”blue circles have positive net migrations


## Justin Davis's Minimum Hourly Wage Map:

Notes: Could be an alternative way to show change over time if we are not able to animate data. This map demonstrates the percentage of all US hourly workers that earn minimum wage or less. Each map in the set of small multiples provides a yearly snapshot of minimum wage workers going as far back as 2002. When you hover over a state, the percentage of workers for that area is noted and looking year-by-year, state-by-state you can see if there is an upward or downward trend.

## Scott Teal's FIFA World Cup Rating Info Map:

<img width="1096" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-17 at 10 25 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97418760/163759280-20426e2b-a5b5-4478-8735-927ba7e2fe3b.png">

https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/scott.teal/viz/2018FIFAWorldCupRatings/2018FIFAWorldCupRatings

Notes: The addtional graphs provide interesting analysis that we thing our project could benifit from. This visualization is a blend of teams and players in the 2018 World Cup tournament, combined with player ratings from FIFA 18. The use of heat maps can also be an effetive tool since we are dealing with a large volume of complex data points.
